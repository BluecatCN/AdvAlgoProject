This repository contains the implementation of different approaches/algorithms for solving Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). Work is under progress.

Comment for ExtractData.py
  I just added one new method to deal with the "MATRIX" kind of data. This kind of data will provide data with triangular matrix. 
And for that I use a python package called TSPlib95.
  TSPlib95 installation is literally easy using just one command line. "pip install tsplib95" -- just make sure your pip version is the latest version.
